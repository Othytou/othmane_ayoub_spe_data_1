Predicting the yearly land average temperature, rather than air temperature, can provide specific insights into climate change effects for several reasons:

- Sensitivity to Changes: Land temperatures often react more quickly to climate change than air temperatures over the sea. This makes land temperature a sensitive indicator of short-term changes in the climate system.
- Direct Impact on Ecosystems: Changes in land temperature can have a direct impact on terrestrial ecosystems and agriculture. Predicting these temperatures can help in planning for crop viability, water needs, and biodiversity conservation.
- Data Availability: There is often more historical data available for land temperatures, which can help improve the accuracy and reliability of climate models.
- Feedback Mechanisms: Land surfaces exhibit different feedback mechanisms, such as changes in vegetation cover and soil moisture, which can amplify or mitigate climate change. Understanding these mechanisms through land temperature predictions is crucial for accurate climate modeling.
